- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

## Notes

âœ… **VALIDATION PASSED** - All checklist items completed successfully. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

- All functional requirements are testable and specific
- Success criteria include concrete metrics (100% accuracy, zero duplicates, <100ms performance)
- User scenarios cover the critical P1 bug fixes with independent test cases
- No implementation details present - specification remains business-focused
