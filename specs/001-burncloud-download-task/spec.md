# Feature Specification: Duplicate Download Detection

**Feature Branch**: `001-burncloud-download-task`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "我现在已经编写好了burncloud-download代码，但是如果碰到重复下载的文件，他并没有使用旧的下载文件，而是创建新的下载，这样不对，需要进行修改代码。碰到重复的下载文件，则需要找出来旧的下载task_id"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Resume Existing Download (Priority: P1)

When a user attempts to download a file that was previously started but not completed, the system automatically resumes the existing download task instead of creating a new one.

**Why this priority**: This prevents duplicate downloads, saves bandwidth, storage space, and provides better user experience by maintaining download progress.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting a download, interrupting it, then requesting the same file again and verifying the original task ID is reused.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a download task exists for file "example.zip" with task_id "12345" and is 50% complete, **When** user requests download of "example.zip" again, **Then** system resumes task_id "12345" from 50% completion
2. **Given** a download task exists but was paused, **When** user requests the same file, **Then** system resumes the existing paused task
3. **Given** multiple partial downloads exist for the same file, **When** user requests the file, **Then** system uses the most recent valid task

### User Story 2 - Detect Completed Downloads (Priority: P2)

When a user attempts to download a file that has already been successfully downloaded, the system identifies the existing completed download and provides access to it.

**Why this priority**: Prevents unnecessary re-downloads of completed files, saving time and resources while providing immediate access to already downloaded content.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing a download, then requesting the same file and verifying the system points to the existing completed download.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a download task for "document.pdf" is 100% complete with task_id "67890", **When** user requests "document.pdf" again, **Then** system returns reference to existing completed task_id "67890"
2. **Given** a completed download exists, **When** user explicitly requests to re-download, **Then** system offers option to use existing or create new download

---

### User Story 3 - Handle Failed Download Recovery (Priority: P3)

When a user attempts to download a file that previously failed, the system can restart or retry the existing download task based on the failure reason.

**Why this priority**: Provides recovery mechanism for failed downloads without losing the download history and context.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by causing a download to fail, then requesting the same file and verifying appropriate recovery action.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a download task failed due to network error, **When** user requests the same file, **Then** system offers to retry using the existing task_id
2. **Given** a download task failed due to invalid URL, **When** user requests the same file, **Then** system creates new task but preserves failure history

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the same file is requested with different source URLs?
- How does system handle when original download file was manually deleted but task still exists?
- What occurs when multiple users request the same file simultaneously?
- How does system behave when file metadata (size, checksum) differs from original download?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST identify duplicate download requests by comparing file identifiers (URL, filename, size)
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve existing task_id for previously initiated downloads of the same file
- **FR-003**: System MUST resume incomplete downloads using the original task_id instead of creating new tasks
- **FR-004**: System MUST distinguish between active, paused, completed, and failed download states
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain download history with task_id mapping to file identifiers
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle cases where multiple download attempts exist for the same file by selecting the most appropriate existing task
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide option to force new download when user explicitly wants to re-download completed files
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate that existing download task is still valid (file not corrupted, source still accessible)

### Key Entities

- **Download Task**: Represents a download operation with unique task_id, file metadata, progress status, and timestamps
- **File Identifier**: Composite key used to match duplicate downloads (URL, filename, file size, checksum when available)
- **Task Status**: Enumeration of download states (pending, active, paused, completed, failed, cancelled)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users receive existing download task_id within 1 second when requesting duplicate downloads
- **SC-002**: System reduces redundant download bandwidth usage by 80% for duplicate file requests
- **SC-003**: 95% of resumed downloads continue from their previous progress point without data loss
- **SC-004**: Zero new task creation when valid existing download task exists for the same file
- **SC-005**: Users can successfully resume interrupted downloads 99% of the time when file source remains available

## Assumptions

- File uniqueness is determined by URL and basic metadata (size, name)
- Download tasks persist in a searchable storage system
- Users primarily want to resume or reuse existing downloads rather than create duplicates
- Network interruptions are temporary and files remain available at original URLs
- Download progress tracking is already implemented in the current system
